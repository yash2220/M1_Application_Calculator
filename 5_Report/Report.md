# Requirements
## Introduction
 A Scientific calculator is a device which can perform some mathematical operations like arthmetic operations
& scinetific operations i.e here In this project we are going to implement some calculator operations using
C Language with a Command Line Interface ( CLI ) where it can perform operations like :
 -   Arthemetic Operations 
 -   Scientific Operations 
 -   Trignometric Operations
## Research
[Research paper](https://www.informs.org/Publications/INFORMS-Journals/Mathematics-of-Operations-Research)
The Scientific calculator doesn't involve any complex operations or any operations. It is easy to apply the values in the system to find the required result rather than remembering and applying it in formula. Thus by studying all these facts, the necessary functions has been implemented to get the required results in a better way.
## Cost and Features
Depending upon the project how well it is built and all the requirements will meet the cost and it can be varied according to the market.
- Addition : The addition Add() function takes two operands as input and the function results in a+b.
- Subtraction : The subtraction Sub() function takes two operands as input and the function results in a-b.
- Multiplication : The multiplication Mul() function takes two operands as input and the function results in a*b.
- Division : The division Div() function takes two operands as input and the function results in a/b.
- Log : The log log10() function takes one operand as input and the function results in log10(x) value.
- Power : The power() function takes two operands as input and the function results in X^Y value.
- Squareroot : The sqrt() function takes one operand as input and the function results in âˆšx.
- Sin : The sin() function takes one operand as input and the function results in desired value.
- Cos : The cos() function takes one operand as input and the function results in desired value.
- Tan : The tan() function takes one operand as input and the function results in desired value.
